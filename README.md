How to install a Galaxy instance with a Shiny Interactive Environment
=====================================================================

If you don't have a Galaxy instance, follow the [Galaxy_instance.md](https://github.com/RomainDallet/Shiny_GIE_installation/blob/master/Galaxy_instance.md).

To configure your proxy (nginx), read the [Galaxy_proxy.md](https://github.com/RomainDallet/Shiny_GIE_installation/blob/master/Galaxy_proxy.md).
Apache has not been tested.

Finally, to install a Shiny Galaxy Interactive Environment, follow the [GIE_Shiny.md](https://github.com/RomainDallet/Shiny_GIE_installation/blob/master/GIE_Shiny.md).
